// Given that an EMPLOYEE class contains following members: Employee Number,
// Employee Name, Basic, DA,Â IT, Net Salary. Member functions: to read the data, to calculate
// Net Salary and to print data members. Write a C++ program to read the data of N
// employees and compute Net Salary of each employee. (Dearness Allowance (DA) = 52% of
// Basic and Income Tax (IT) = 30% of the gross salary. Net Salary = Basic + DA - IT).
