// A gas station inspector needs to inspect n > 1 gas stations located
// equidistantly along a straight highway. The stations are numbered
// consecutively from 1 to n. The inspector starts at station 1, which he
// will need to visit one more time. He will also need to visit station n twice,
// where he may but does not have to finish his tour. As to stations 2 through
// n- 1, he needs to inspect them an equal number of times. For exe,
// he might go from station 1 to station n, turn back and return to station 1,
// and then go to station n again to complete his task there. (It is assumed,
// of course, that the inspector visits the stations every time he passes them.)
// The question is whether this is the shortest tour possible that satisfies all
// the requirements stated. If it is, prove it: if it is not, find the shortest one.
